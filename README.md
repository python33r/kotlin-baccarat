# kotlin-baccarat

Simulation of a simplified version of the card game [Baccarat][bac], written
in Kotlin.

This is essentially a Kotlin conversion of some old Java-based COMP1721
coursework, created to help me reacquaint myself with Kotlin and also as a
way of gaining familiarity with the [kotest][ko] testing framework.
