# kotlin-cards

Card game simulations, written in Kotlin.

This repository contains Kotlin conversions of old Java-based COMP1721
coursework, created to help me reacquaint myself with Kotlin and also as a
way of gaining familiarity with the [kotest][ko] testing framework.

Current contents:

* Base library for representing cards & collections of cards
* Simulation of a simplified version of the card game [Baccarat][bac]
* Partial simulation of [Blackjack][jack]
* Program to estimate probabilities of [Poker hands][poker]
