# kotlin-cards

Card game simulations, written in Kotlin.

This repository contains Kotlin conversions of old Java-based COMP1721
coursework, created to help me reacquaint myself with Kotlin and also as a
way of gaining familiarity with the [kotest][ko] testing framework.

Currently there is a base library for representing cards and collections
of cards, plus a simulation of a simplified version of the card game
[Baccarat][bac].
